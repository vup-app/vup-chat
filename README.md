# vup_chat

A cross-platform, ATProto & S5 powered chat client.

### Goal:

Create a chat platform that is fully compatible with Bluesky, but when both users are using vup chat, the connection
upgrades to a E2EE S5 streams based implementation.

### Roadmap:

- [x] Basic text chatting between bsky users
- [ ] Bsky profile editing
- [ ] Push notifications ATProto
- [ ] UI overhaul v1
- [ ] S5 streams between users
- [ ] Sending images & videos
- [ ] Push notifications S5 Streams
- [ ] Video & Voice call
- [ ] Group Chats
- [ ] UI overhaul v2
- [ ] Larger ATProto chat rooms (discord-ish)
