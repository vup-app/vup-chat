# Vup Chat

A cross-platform, ATProto & S5 powered chat client.

![](static/UI.png)

### What

Vup Chat is a messaging client build on top of the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/). It both provides dedicated messaging clients for cross-platform usage. By utilizing the S5 network, it allows users to have more advanced features like E2EE and media embeds (coming soon).

### Usage

> ⚠️ This app is still in rapid development, so things are likely to change and break. All messages are currently backed up to ATProto. Once E2EE is implemented, the DB will become stable and breaking changes will not be pushed on minor (x.X.x) versions.
